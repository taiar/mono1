This is the first of a post series where I'm going to talk about some new
programming languages with a nice future ahead. During this series I'll explore
deeper the **Ceylon**, **Dart**, **Elixir**, **Rust** and **Swift 2** languages.

The plan is to make a post a week until December 15 (or maybe a little more) and
spend 2 weeks exploring each one of them. In the first week I'll explore the
general aspects of the language and make some comparisons with other very known
and established languages. In the post of the second week I'll go deeper inside
each one of the languages and explore the individual advantages on use them.

## Preface

There are hundred of programming languages out there. Which one should we use?
Which help do we have to choose well? How do they compare to each other? This
document is an attempt to provide some answers to these questions. Naturally, it
would not be possible to provide complete answers: as I mentioned, there are too
many programming languages. Nevertheless, we chose five languages with a
potential to grow in importance in the coming years. These programming languages
are Elixir, Rust, Dart, Swift and Ceylon. During this project, we shall be
talking about each one of them. These discussions will be in breath, not in
depth. Their goal is to provide the reader with the minimum of information
necessary to compare them, and who knows, to lure one or other interested person
in learning them in a greater level of details. In any case, we hope to
contribute a bit to the popularization of these programming languages, which -
likely - will be paramount to the development of computer science in the next
ten years.

## Ceylon

### How did it appear?

Red Hat is the world's leading provider of open source software solutions
and it has initiated and sponsors the development of the Ceylon programming
language. Ceylon is first and foremost an open source community project.

According to the language's F.A.Q, Ceylon was designed to be a modern Java with
better specification, as we can see in the excerpt:

> Well, we've been designing and building frameworks and libraries for Java for
> ten years, and we know its limitations intimately. And we're frustrated. The
> most recent releases of Java go some distance to alleviating some problems,
> but even the newest language features strain to accommodate past mistakes and
> the requirement for full backward compatibility.
>
> But much of our frustration is not even with the Java language itself. The
> extremely outdated class libraries that form the Java SE SDK are riddled with
> problems. Developing a great SDK is a top priority of the project.

### Why was it designed and implemented?

Ceylon has a lot of interesting features but, we can start with this
definition on the homepage: _"Ceylon is a language for writing large programs in
teams"_. The language is deeply influenced by Java and it was designed and
implemented by people who where hugely involved with Java. People like Gavin
King, the lead of the Ceylon project in Red Hat and also the creator of
Hibernate (the most popular Object Relational Mapper for Java) and other
projects in the Oracle's platform.

Modularity is in the very core of the Ceylon language. When a Ceylon's code is
compiled, it produces module archives. In fact is very similar to Java's
modules. It generates a _*.car_ file, with _*.class_ files zipped on it. Just
like Java's _*.jar_. You'll never be exposed to unpacked _*.class_ files in
Ceylon. So here we got 2 conclusions. The first one is that the compiler
really forces the modularity and facilitates the distribution of the generated
code. The second one is that the Ceylon compiled code runs on the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM). This second fact is very important because by running on the JVM,
Ceylon's code is fully interoperable with Java, the Java SDK and its libraries.
In fact, this interoperability is a major priority of the project.

<!-- exemplo de c칩digo interoper치vel com Java -->
This is an example of the use of the Java's HashMap data structure on a Ceylon
program:

``` js
import java.util { HashMap }

value javaHashMap = HashMap<String,Integer>();
javaHashMap.put("zero", 0);
javaHashMap.put("one", 1);
javaHashMap.put("two", 2);
print(javaHashMap.values());
```

Ceylon runs on the Javascript virtual machine too. In fact the Ceylon's compiler
can generate Javascript code if its told to do so. It generates modular
Javascript in the CommonJS modules format. We'll see more on Javascript
generation in the future.

<!-- TODO inserir aqui um exemplo de c칩digo interoper치vel com Javascript -->
``` js
dynamic {
    dynamic req = XMLHttpRequest();
    req.onreadystatechange = void () {
        if (req.readyState==4) {
            document.getElementById("greeting")
                    .innerHTML = req.status==200
                            then req.responseText
                            else "error";
        }
    };
    req.open("GET", "/sayHello", true);
    req.send();
}
```

Ceylon's project always tells how important is the toolset for a complete and
successful programing project so it ships with a really great Integrated
Development Environment (IDE) built on a Eclipse plug-in. We'll see more
detailed information on the **install and run** section below.

### How can we use it, e.g., install and run?

By running in the JVM, the Ceylon's compiler compiler got the advantage to run
on every operating system that have a Java Virtual Machine implementation. It  
runs both on Java 7 and Java 8 (prior versions are not supported). So before
install the Ceylon package, be sure to have the correct Java version installed.
During the series, I'm working on the 1.1 version of the language, released in
09 October 2014.

For installation on a Mac, you can use the Homebrew installer:

```
brew update
brew install ceylon
```

There are packages for both Debian and Fedora/Red Hat GNU/Linux flavors on the
project's download page: [http://ceylon-lang.org/download/](http://ceylon-lang.org/download/).

For a platform agnostic installation, download the zip archive (http://ceylon-lang.org/download/dist/1_1_0),
unzip on your system's prefered folder and add the **/ceylon-1.1.0/bin** folder
to the path of your system. In a unix-like system you can do that by adding the
line below on the **~/.bashrc** file of you user's directory:

```
export PATH="/path/to/ceylon-1.1.0/bin:$PATH"
```

Now lets check if the installation works. By forcing the modularity, Ceylon
implies some conventions on the compilation process. At firt the code we'll
write must be on a **"source"** directory. So place the following code on a file
called **"./source/hello.ceylon"**:

``` java
shared void hello() {
  print("Hello Ceylon!");
}
```

Outside the **source's** folder, run the command:

```
ceylon compile source/hello.ceylon
```

Checkout the **module** folder created on the same level as the **source**
folder. Check it's content for the _*.car_ file and some others. To run the
compiled source, run the following command:

```
ceylon run --run hello default
```

### Simple programs

#### The treelike structure

I'll use this example to illustrate the treelike structure that Ceylon has.
Ceylon's named argument lists provide an elegant means of initializing objects
and collections. The goal of this facility is to replace the use of XML for
expressing hierarchical structures such as documents, user interfaces,
configuration and serialized data.

I'll use this notation to create a binary search tree and make a depth-first
in-order traversal.

```js
shared class Node(val, left = null, right = null) {
	shared Integer val;
	shared Node? left;
	shared Node? right;
}

shared void caminhamento_central(Node b) {
	if(exists next = b.left) {
		caminhamento_central(next);
	}
	process.write(b.val.string + " ");
	if(exists next = b.right) {
		caminhamento_central(next);
	}
}

shared void run() {

	Node arvore = Node {
		val = 1;
		left = Node {
			val = 2;
			left = Node {
				val = 4;
				left = Node { val = 8; };
				right = Node { val = 9; };
			};
			right = Node {
				val = 5;
				left = Node { val = 10; };
				right = Node { val = 11; };
			};
		};
		right = Node {
			val = 3;
			left = Node {
				val = 6;
				left = Node { val = 12; };
				right = Node { val = 13; };
			};
			right = Node {
				val = 7;
				left = Node { val = 17; };
				right = Node { val = 15; };
			};
		};
	};

	caminhamento_central(arvore);
	print("");
}
```

The result of this program must be:
```
8 4 9 2 10 5 11 1 12 6 13 3 17 7 15
```

#### Random numbers

The Ceylon SDK still under development and on each version, more and more
functionalities are added to the group. There aren't random numbers
implementation yet, so I'll use the Java random numbers interface to work on
a Ceylon's simple example.

``` js
// Import from Java SDK
import java.util { Random }

// "shared" method, we'll see more later
shared Integer getRandomInteger(Integer a, Integer b, Random r) {
	value range = b - a + 1;
	value fraction = (range * r.nextDouble());
	return (fraction + a).integer; // cast from Float to Integer
}

shared void run() {
    Random random = Random();
    for(number in 1..100) { // here we use a Sequence, more on that later
        print(getRandomInteger(1, 100, random));
    }
}
```
